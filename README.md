# Unmagic Hexagon

The unmagic hexagon is a twist on the magic hexagon problem.  An unmagic hexagon consists of the numbers 1 through 7 arranged in a hexagonal shape, with a row of two, a row of three, and another row of two.  Such a hexagon has six rows of two, and three rows of three, making a total of nine rows, regardless of length.

For the hexagon to be considered "unmagic," the numbers must be arranged in such a way that each of the nine rows has a different sum.  There are several solutions to this problem.  I used brute force and an Excel spreadsheet to find them all.

Many of the solutions are simply rotations and reflections of the others.  Each solution has twelve possible orientations.  Starting with one solution, five more can be generated simply by rotating the hexagon.  From these six solutions, six more can be generated by reflecting them.  Seven numbers can be arranged in 7! = 5040 different ways, but these allow for only 5040/12 = 420 truly unique possibilities.  Only a handful of these qualify as unmagic hexagons.
